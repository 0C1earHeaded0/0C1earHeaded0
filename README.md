<h1 align="center">Hello there, I'm Kirill! 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm Applied Mathematics and Informatics third-year student from Russia 🇷🇺</h3>

- I'm working as a Data Analyst in health organization now. So, I usually work with OracleDB and Postgresql and such BI-system as Apache Superset. Moreover I have to know a few more technologies like Apache Airflow (DAG-writing), Docker, Docker-Compose and others to feel comfortable.
- When I was second-year student I used to like frontend development. That's why I know HTML, CSS (Basic and Tailwind) and JS above average.
- Additionally, I like backend development and try to develop for my soul. Especially I use NodeJS and it's libraries (Express, Axios, Sequelize, ...) for it.

  <h3>That's all for now. Thank you for attention 🖐️</h3>
