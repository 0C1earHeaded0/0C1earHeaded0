<h1 align="center">Hello there, I'm Kirill! 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm Applied Mathematics and Informatics third-year student from Russia 🇷🇺</h3>

<p style="text-indent: 2cm">I'm working as a Data Analyst in health organization now. So, I usually work with OracleDB and Postgresql and such BI-system as Apache Superset. Moreover I have to know a few more technologies like Apache Airflow (DAG-writing), Docker, Docker-Compose and others to feel comfortable.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2cm">When I was second-year student I used to like frontend development. That's why I know HTML, CSS (Basic and Tailwind) and JS above average.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2cm">Additionally, I like backend development and try to develop for my soul. Especially I use NodeJS and it's libraries (Express, Axios, Sequelize, ...) for it.</p>

  <h3>That's all for now. Thank you for attention 🖐️</h3>
