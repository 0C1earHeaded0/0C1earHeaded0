<h1 align="center">Hello there, I'm Kirill! 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm Applied Mathematics and Informatics third-year student from Russia 🇷🇺</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm working as a Data Analyst in health organization now. So, I usually work with <b>OracleDB</b> and <b>Postgresql</b> and such BI-system as <b>Apache Superset</b>. Moreover I have to know a few more technologies like <b>Apache Airflow (DAG-writing)</b>, <b>Docker</b>, <b>Docker-Compose</b> and others to feel comfortable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was second-year student I used to like frontend development. That's why I know <b>HTML, CSS (Basic and Tailwind)</b> and <b>JS</b> above average.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, I like backend development and try to develop for my soul. Especially I use <b>NodeJS</b> and it's libraries (<b>Express, Axios, Sequelize, ...</b>) for it.</p>

<h3>That's all for now. Thank you for attention 🖐️</h3>
